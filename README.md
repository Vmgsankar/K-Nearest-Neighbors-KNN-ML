# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-ML
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm to predict the type of crop based on various environmental and soil factors. The model is trained using data that includes features like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall.
